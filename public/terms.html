        <p>Terms of Service</p>
        <p>Effective Date: 04/01/2023</p>
        <p>As of April 1st, 2023, the following Herogo TV Terms of Service create a legally binding agreement (referred to as the “Agreement”) between Herogo TV, Inc. (“Herogo TV”) and you. If you represent an entity or organization, this Agreement also applies to that entity or organization (collectively referred to as “You”, “you”, or “your”).</p>
        <p>Through the Herogo TV website and other websites, web services, applications, and video players provided and operated by Herogo TV (the “Herogo TV Platform”), users (“Users”) have access to various audiovisual content, information, data, and other materials (“Content”). The Herogo TV Platform, Content, and any additional services, functions, and resources (“Services”) are only available under the terms of this Agreement. Herogo TV and You entered into this Agreement on the earliest date that You accessed the Services or agreed to this Agreement, as specified below (the “Effective Date”).</p>
        <p>Please read this Agreement carefully. By using the Services or indicating your agreement to this Agreement by registering your account, clicking “I accept,” or any other similar method, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not access or use the Service or register an account. If you access or use the Service or register an Account on behalf of a company, principal, or other entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to this Agreement and that it is fully binding on them. In such case, the term “you,” as used in this Agreement, will refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, you may not access or use the Service. Please note that this Agreement contains disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability that may apply to you.</p>

        <span class="list_item">1. DEFINITIONS.</span>
        <p>In this Agreement, terms will be defined as outlined in this Agreement. If a term is not defined in this Agreement, it will be interpreted based on its commonly understood meaning in the United States.</p>

        <span class="list_item">2. TERM.</span>
        <p>The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and will continue as follows: (a) for Paid Subscriptions (as defined herein), the duration of the Agreement will depend on the type of subscription you have, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 13 herein; and (b) for all other access or use of the Services, the term of the Agreement will continue until terminated earlier in accordance with Section 13 herein.</p>

                <div class="lists mt10">
                    <ul>
                        <li>a. Free Trial. Some portions of the Services and Content are available on a paid subscription basis. To access these portions of the Services, you must choose to receive either a Monthly Paid Subscription or an Annual Paid Subscription (together with a Monthly Paid Subscription, the “Paid Subscriptions”) by making a Subscription Election. Once fees (the “Fees”) have been paid to Herogo TV, they are generally non-refundable, including upon termination or suspension of this Agreement, unless prohibited under applicable law. When you opt for a Paid Subscription, you may be eligible for a free trial subscription to the Services (“Trial Subscription”) under specific conditions. During the Trial Subscription, you may access the Services without being obligated to pay Fees. The Trial Subscription period will begin when you choose to receive a Paid Subscription, which will automatically renew on a month-to-month or annual basis at the end of the stipulated period after your Subscription Election (“Trial Period”) ends, subject to certain conditions. Unless you cancel or modify it before the expiration of the Trial Period (“Trial Termination Notice”) in accordance with these Terms of Service, the Trial Subscription will continue. You can cancel before the Trial Subscription period ends by visiting www.herogotv/account and canceling online anytime or by contacting Herogo TV through chat/phone support (when available) and requesting cancellation of your account. Cancellation requests made via mail, social media, email, Contact Us form, app reviews, etc. will not be accepted. If you give Herogo TV your Trial Termination Notice before the Trial Period expires, your access to the Services may be terminated at that time or any point between the date of your Trial Termination Notice and the expiration of the Trial Period. If you notify Herogo TV that you want to receive a different Paid Subscription to the Services before the Trial Period ends, your access to Herogo TV will automatically convert to such a Paid Subscription at that time or at the expiration of the Trial Period. You are only allowed to receive one Trial Subscription. Any attempt by You to receive more than one Trial Subscription, such as by creating alternate accounts, will be considered a material breach of this Agreement.</li>
                        <li> b. Monthly Subscription. You may choose to receive a monthly prepaid subscription to the Services (“Monthly Paid Subscription”). Monthly prepaid Subscriptions will renew automatically for an additional one-month period, unless you choose to cancel prior to the expiration of the then-current monthly subscription term by visiting www.herogotv/account and canceling online anytime or by contacting Herogo TV through chat/phone support (when available) and requesting cancellation of your account. Cancellation requests made via mail, social media, email, Contact Us form, app reviews, etc. will not be accepted. Since charges are prepaid each billing period, when you cancel your subscription, your subscription will continue through the end of the then-current billing period, in accordance with these Terms of Service.</li>
                        <li>c. Annual Subscription. You may also choose to receive an annual prepaid subscription to the Services (“Annual Paid Subscription”), if available. Annual prepaid Subscriptions will renew automatically for an additional one-year period unless you choose to cancel before the expiration of the then-current annual subscription term by visiting www.herogotv/account and canceling online anytime or by contacting Herogo TV through chat/phone support (when available) and requesting cancellation of your account.
                            Cancellation requests made via mail, social media, email, Contact Us form, app reviews, etc. will not be accepted. Since charges are prepaid each billing period, when you cancel your subscription, your subscription will continue through the end of the then-current billing period, in accordance with these Terms of Service.</li>
                        <li> d. Packages of Subscription. Herogo TV may offer various subscription packages, including promotional packages, each governed by any supplemental Promotional Terms provided at the time of your first access or use of such Subscriptions. Some promotional packages may be offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. Herogo TV is not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Herogo TV reserves the right to modify, terminate, or amend the subscriptions offered, and the contents of the packages and levels thereof.</li>
                        <li>e. Minimum Requirements. Herogo TV reserves the right to require and/or change minimum programming package requirements, from time to time and at any time, in its sole and absolute discretion. For example, Herogo TV may require a minimum commitment term, or Herogo TV may require you to subscribe to a minimum level or package of a subscription to view certain content or gain access to purchase additional levels or packages of a subscription. To purchase certain packages, you may be required to subscribe to a subscription for a set term (e.g., a year-long subscription).</li>
                        <li>f. Promotional Offers. You may initially accept a promotional offer for a specific subscription package that may later become unavailable. Promotional offers do not renew automatically and may not be available at the end of, or during, the applicable promotional period. Following the completion of any such promotion, the subscription will renew automatically on a month-to-month or annual basis at the then-current standard rates for monthly or annual access to the same subscription, unless and until they are cancelled or changed by you or Herogo TV, in accordance with this Agreement.</li>
                        <li>g. Only One Promotion per Account Owner. Promotional offers may not be combined with other promotional offers associated with any account that you own, unless otherwise expressly permitted in the applicable Promotional Terms. Herogo TV reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for any promotional offer pursuant to the applicable Promotional Terms. Herogo TV reserves the right to change, amend, and alter then-current promotional offers or Promotional Terms as well as institute new promotional offers, from time to time and at any time, in its sole and absolute discretion. Herogo TV does not guarantee that any promotional offers are or will be available to you at all, or in connection with any subscriptions desired by you.</li>

Your Personal Information: By using the Platform, you agree to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information, as well as any other information or data resulting from your access to and use of the Platform, Services or Content, in accordance with the Privacy Policy for the Platform available at [insert link] (“Privacy Policy”) at the time you provide such information to Herogo TV. However, Herogo TV has the right to collect and use non-personally identifiable information or data (information or data that does not identify a natural person or entity as the source) related to your access to and use of the Platform, Services or Content. Herogo TV owns any such non-personally identifiable data and information and may use it for any lawful business purpose without any further obligation to you.</p>
        <p>b. Other Users’ Information: The Platform provides you with access to data and other information provided by other Users of the Platform and third parties (“User Information”).

        <span class="list_item">11. FEES. </span>
        <p>By using the Platform and its Content and Services, you agree to pay all applicable fees (“Fees”) to Herogo TV for Your Paid Subscription. In addition, you agree to pay any other amounts due or payable to any third parties under the terms of any Third Party Content and Services Agreement. Monthly Paid Subscriptions require monthly payments in advance, with the first payment due and payable on the first day of your subscription following the Trial Period. Subsequent monthly payments will be made on the same day as the first month if it falls within the billing month. If not, payments will be made on either the 28th or the 30th day of that billing month at the discretion of Herogo TV. Annual Paid Subscriptions require annual payments in advance, with the first payment due and payable on the first day of your subscription following the Trial Period. Subsequent annual payments will be made on the same day as the first annual payment if it falls within the billing month. If not, payments will be made on either the 28th or the 30th day of that billing month at the discretion of Herogo TV.</p>
        <p>All other Fees will be due and payable as specified through the Platform. If You provide a credit card, debit card, online payment account, mobile services account, or any other payment method to Herogo TV, You authorize Herogo TV to charge the applicable payment account for all Fees incurred under this Agreement. When registering a credit or debit card for a new account, Herogo TV may place a pending charge to verify the billing address and validity of the card. Pending charges are temporary and will not be converted into an actual charge. Pending charges, however, will reduce the available credit or funds available on the card. You are responsible for any fees charged to Your card, including fees for overdraft, insufficient funds, or exceeding credit limits. Once Your account is authenticated, Herogo TV will charge the registered credit or debit card for each transaction without having to re-enter credit or debit card information.</p>

    <p>All Fees paid to Herogo TV are non-refundable, except as prohibited under applicable law, and will remain so even upon termination or suspension of this Agreement. Past due amounts will bear an additional charge of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount permitted under applicable law until paid in full. If Herogo TV requires the use of collection agencies, attorneys, or courts of law to collect Your account, You will be responsible for those expenses. You will also be responsible for any use, sales, or other taxes imposed on the Services provided under this Agreement.</p>
